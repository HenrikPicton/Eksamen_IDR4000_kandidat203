  abstract = {Abstract             The aim of this study was to compare the effects of progressive overload in                     resistance training on muscle strength and cross-sectional area (CSA) by                     specifically comparing the impact of increasing load (LOADprog) versus an                     increase in repetitions (REPSprog). We used a within-subject experimental design                     in which 39 previously untrained young persons (20 men and 19 women) had their                     legs randomized to LOADprog and REPSprog. Outcomes were assessed before and                     after 10 weeks of training. Muscle strength was assessed using the one                     repetition maximum (1RM) test on the leg extension exercise, and the CSA of the                     vastus lateralis was assessed by ultrasonography. Both protocols increased 1RM                     values from pre (LOADprog: 52.90\textpm 16.32\,kg; REPSprog: 51.67\textpm 15.84\,kg) to post                     (LOADprog: 69.05\textpm 18.55\,kg, REPSprog: 66.82\textpm 17.95\,kg), with no difference between                     them (P+{$>$}+0.05). Similarly, both protocols also increased in CSA                     values from pre (LOADprog: 21.34\textpm 4.71\,cm{$^2$}; REPSprog: 21.08\textpm 4.62\,cm{$^2$}) to post                     (LOADprog: 23.53\textpm 5.41\,cm{$^2$}, REPSprog: 23.39\textpm 5.19\,cm{$^2$}), with no difference between                     them (P+{$>$}+0.05). In conclusion, our findings indicate that the                     progression of overload through load or repetitions can be used to promote gains                     in strength and muscle hypertrophy in young men and women in the early stages of                     training.},

Greater gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy after partial range of motion training performed at long muscle lengths.               J Strength Cond Res               37(9): 1746--1753, 2023---Whether there is an optimal range of motion (ROM) to induce muscle hypertrophy remains elusive, especially for gastrocnemius. This study aimed to compare the changes in gastrocnemius muscle thickness between calf raise exercise performed with full ROM (FULL               ROM               ), partial ROM performed in the initial (INITIAL               ROM               ), and final (FINAL               ROM               ) portions of the ROM. Forty-two young women performed a calf training program for 8 weeks, 3 days{$\cdot$}week               -1               , with differences in the calf raise ROM configuration. The calf raise exercise was performed in a pin-loaded, horizontal, leg-press machine, in 3 sets of 15--20 repetition maximum. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: FULL               ROM               (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), INITIAL               ROM               (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to 0{$^\circ$}), and FINAL               ROM               (ankle: 0{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), where 0{$^\circ$} was defined as an angle of 90{$^\circ$} of the foot with the tibia. The muscle thickness measurements of medial and lateral gastrocnemius were taken by means of B-mode ultrasound. INITIAL               ROM               elicited greater medial gastrocnemius increases than FULL               ROM               and FINAL               ROM               (INITIAL               ROM               = +15.2\% vs. FULL               ROM               = +6.7\% and FINAL               ROM               = +3.4\%;               p               {$\leq$} 0.009). Furthermore, INITIAL               ROM               elicited greater lateral gastrocnemius increases than FINAL               ROM               (INITIAL               ROM               = +14.9\% vs. FINAL               ROM               = +6.2\%;               p               {$<$} 0.024) but did not significantly differ from FULL               ROM               (FULL               ROM               = +7.3\%;               p               = 0.060). The current results suggest that calf training performed at longer muscle lengths may optimize gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy in young women. Therefore, when prescribing hypertrophy-oriented training, the inclusion of the calf raise exercise performed with partial ROM in the initial portion of the excursion should be considered.},

This study aimed to compare the changes in lower limbs maximal dynamic strength (1RM) and quadriceps femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) after a RT with different weekly frequencies in strength-trained individuals using a within-subject design. Twenty-four men participated in a 9-week RT program, being randomly divided into two conditions: resistance training with equalized total training volume (RTEV) and with unequalized total training volume (RTUV). The RT protocol used the unilateral leg press 45{$^\circ$} exercise and each subject's lower limb executed one of the proposed frequencies (one and three times/week). All conditions effectively increased 1RM and CSA (p{$<$}0.001); however, no significant differences were observed in the values of 1RM (p = 0.454) and CSA (p = 0.310) between the RT frequencies in the RTEV and RTUV conditions. Therefore, RT performed three times a week showed similar increases in 1RM and CSA to the program performed once a week, regardless of training volume equalization. Nevertheless, when the higher RT frequency allowed the application of a greater TTV (i.e., RTUV), higher effect size (ES) values (0.51 and 0.63, 1RM and CSA, respectively) were observed for the adaptations.},

  abstract = {Limited research exists examining how resistance training to failure affects applied outcomes and single motor unit characteristics in previously trained individuals. Herein, resistance-trained adults (24\,\textpm\,3\,years old, self-reported resistance training experience was 6\,\textpm\,4\,years, 11 men and 8 women) were randomly assigned to either a low-repetitions-in-reserve (RIR; i.e., training near failure, n\,=\,10) or high-RIR (i.e., not training near failure, n\,=\,9) group. All participants implemented progressive overload during 5\,weeks where low-RIR performed squat, bench press, and deadlift twice weekly and were instructed to end each training set with 0-1 RIR. high-RIR performed identical training except for being instructed to maintain 4-6 RIR after each set. During week 6, participants performed a reduced volume-load. The following were assessed prior to and following the intervention: (i) vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) at multiple sites; (ii) squat, bench press, and deadlift one-repetition maximums (1RMs); and (iii) maximal isometric knee extensor torque and VL motor unit firing rates during an 80\% maximal voluntary contraction. Although RIR was lower in the low- versus high-RIR group during the intervention (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), total training volume did not significantly differ between groups (p\,=\,0.222). There were main effects of time for squat, bench press, and deadlift 1RMs (all p-values\,{$<$}\,0.05), but no significant condition\,\texttimes\,time interactions existed for these or proximal/middle/distal VL mCSA data. There were significant interactions for the slope and y-intercept of the motor unit mean firing rate versus recruitment threshold relationship. Post hoc analyses indicated low-RIR group slope values decreased and y-intercept values increased after training suggesting low-RIR training increased lower-threshold motor unit firing rates. This study provides insight into how resistance training in proximity to failure affects strength, hypertrophy, and single motor unit characteristics, and may inform those who aim to program for resistance-trained individuals.},

J Strength Cond Res               30(7): 1805--1812, 2016---The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of short rest intervals normally associated with hypertrophy-type training versus long rest intervals traditionally used in strength-type training on muscular adaptations in a cohort of young, experienced lifters. Twenty-one young resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to either a group that performed a resistance training (RT) program with 1-minute rest intervals (SHORT) or a group that employed 3-minute rest intervals (LONG). All other RT variables were held constant. The study period lasted 8 weeks with subjects performing 3 total body workouts a week comprised 3 sets of 8--12 repetition maximum (RM) of 7 different exercises per session. Testing was performed prestudy and poststudy for muscle strength (1RM bench press and back squat), muscle endurance (50\% 1RM bench press to failure), and muscle thickness of the elbow flexors, triceps brachii, and quadriceps femoris by ultrasound imaging. Maximal strength was significantly greater for both 1RM squat and bench press for LONG compared to SHORT. Muscle thickness was significantly greater for LONG compared to SHORT in the anterior thigh, and a trend for greater increases was noted in the triceps brachii (               p               = 0.06) as well. Both groups saw significant increases in local upper body muscle endurance with no significant differences noted between groups. This study provides evidence that longer rest periods promote greater increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy in young resistance-trained men.},

Methods                                Thirty-four healthy resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: a low-volume group performing one set per exercise per training session (                 n                 = 11), a moderate-volume group performing three sets per exercise per training session (                 n                 = 12), or a high-volume group performing five sets per exercise per training session (                 n                 = 11). Training for all routines consisted of three weekly sessions performed on nonconsecutive days for 8 wk. Muscular strength was evaluated with one repetition maximum (RM) testing for the squat and bench press. Upper-body muscle endurance was evaluated using 50\% of subjects bench press 1RM performed to momentary failure. Muscle hypertrophy was evaluated using B-mode ultrasonography for the elbow flexors, elbow extensors, mid-thigh, and lateral thigh.                                                        Results               Results showed significant preintervention to postintervention increases in strength and endurance in all groups, with no significant between-group differences. Alternatively, while all groups increased muscle size in most of the measured sites from preintervention to postintervention, significant increases favoring the higher-volume conditions were seen for the elbow flexors, mid-thigh, and lateral thigh.                                         Conclusions               Marked increases in strength and endurance can be attained by resistance-trained individuals with just three 13-min weekly sessions over an 8-wk period, and these gains are similar to that achieved with a substantially greater time commitment. Alternatively, muscle hypertrophy follows a dose--response relationship, with increasingly greater gains achieved with higher training volumes.},

Post-hoc testing showed no difference between both intervention groups regarding maximal strength and muscle thickness (                 p                 \,=\,0.905--0.983,                 d                 \,=\,0.036--0.087), while flexibility increased in the stretching group (                 p                 \,=\,0.001,                 d                 \,=\,0.789).                                                        Conclusion               Stretching showed increases in maximal strength and hypertrophy, which were comparable with commonly used resistance training. Based on current literature, the influence of mechanical tension as the underlying mechanism is discussed. Furthermore, as equipment and comparatively long stretching durations are requested to induce meaningful strength increases in recreationally active participants, practical application seems limited to special circumstances.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Myofibrils in muscle fibres of different sizes and different ages were examined and measured using phase-contrast and electron microscopy. During the post-natal growth of the mouse biceps brachii muscle the number of myofibnls in some fibres increases from about 75 to 1200 The range of myofibnl size was from 0{$\cdot$}4--12 {$\mu$}m. The distribution of myofibnl sizes in muscles of all ages studied was bimodal             A high incidence of longitudinal splitting of myofibrils was observed with the electron micro scope in differentiating muscle fibres and in some medium and large muscle fibres. Size measurements with the electron microscope showed that the splitting myofibrils were about twice as large as non-splitting myofibrils and that the myofibrils split more or less down the middle. A possible explanation for the splitting is that the peripheral I filaments are pulled at an angle slightly oblique to the myofibnl axis, because of the discrepancy in the A and I-filament lattice spacings. When the myofibnl reaches a certain size the oblique pull of the peripheral I filaments is strong enough to cause the Z disks to rip.             From data on the size, shape and number of myofibnls at different stages of growth it was concluded that longitudinal splitting is the means by which the number of myofibrils increases during post-natal growth.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) are promising reference methods for quantifying whole body and regional skeletal muscle mass. Earlier MRI and CT validation studies used data-acquisition techniques and data-analysis procedures now outdated, evaluated anatomic rather than adipose tissue-free skeletal muscle (ATFSM), studied only the relatively large thigh, or found unduly large estimation errors. The aim of the present study was to compare arm and leg ATFSM cross-sectional area estimates (cm               2               ) by using standard MRI and CT acquisition and image-analysis methods with corresponding cadaver estimates. A second objective was to validate MRI and CT measurements of adipose tissue embedded within muscle (interstitial adipose tissue) and surrounding muscle (subcutaneous adipose tissue). ATFSM area ( n = 119) by MRI [38.9 \textpm{} 22.3 (SD) cm               2               ], CT (39.7 \textpm{} 22.8 cm               2               ), and cadaver (39.5 \textpm{} 23.0 cm               2               ) were not different ( P {$>$} 0.001), and both MRI and CT estimates of ATFSM were highly correlated with corresponding cadaver values [MRI: r = 0.99, SE of estimate (SEE) 3.9 cm               2               , P {$<$} 0.001; and CT: r = 0.99, SEE = 3.8 cm               2               , P {$<$} 0.001]. Similarly good results were observed between MRI- and CT-measured vs. cadaver-measured interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue. For MRI-ATFSM the intraobserver correlation for duplicate measurements in vivo was 0.99 [SEE = 8.7 cm               2               (2.9\%), P {$<$} 0.001]. These findings strongly support the use of MRI and CT as reference methods for appendicular skeletal muscle, interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue measurement in vivo.},

  abstract = {Reliability, the consistency of a test or measurement, is frequently quantified in the movement sciences literature. A common metric is the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In addition, the SEM, which can be calculated from the ICC, is also frequently reported in reliability studies. However, there are several versions of the ICC, and confusion exists in the movement sciences regarding which ICC to use. Further, the utility of the SEM is not fully appreciated. In this review, the basics of classic reliability theory are addressed in the context of choosing and interpreting an ICC. The primary distinction between ICC equations is argued to be one concerning the inclusion (equations 2,1 and 2,k) or exclusion (equations 3,1 and 3,k) of systematic error in the denominator of the ICC equation. Inferential tests of mean differences, which are performed in the process of deriving the necessary variance components for the calculation of ICC values, are useful to determine if systematic error is present. If so, the measurement schedule should be modified (removing trials where learning and/or fatigue effects are present) to remove systematic error, and ICC equations that only consider random error may be safely used. The use of ICC values is discussed in the context of estimating the effects of measurement error on sample size, statistical power, and correlation attenuation. Finally, calculation and application of the SEM are discussed. It is shown how the SEM and its variants can be used to construct confidence intervals for individual scores and to determine the minimal difference needed to be exhibited for one to be confident that a true change in performance of an individual has occurred.},

  abstract = {Anesthesia, critical care, perioperative, and pain research often involves study designs in which the same outcome variable is repeatedly measured or observed over time on the same patients. Such repeatedly measured data are referred to as longitudinal data, and longitudinal study designs are commonly used to investigate changes in an outcome over time and to compare these changes among treatment groups. From a statistical perspective, longitudinal studies usually increase the precision of estimated treatment effects, thus increasing the power to detect such effects. Commonly used statistical techniques mostly assume independence of the observations or measurements. However, values repeatedly measured in the same individual will usually be more similar to each other than values of different individuals and ignoring the correlation between repeated measurements may lead to biased estimates as well as invalid               P               values and confidence intervals. Therefore, appropriate analysis of repeated-measures data requires specific statistical techniques. This tutorial reviews 3 classes of commonly used approaches for the analysis of longitudinal data. The first class uses summary statistics to condense the repeatedly measured information to a single number per subject, thus basically eliminating within-subject repeated measurements and allowing for a straightforward comparison of groups using standard statistical hypothesis tests. The second class is historically popular and comprises the repeated-measures analysis of variance type of analyses. However, strong assumptions that are seldom met in practice and low flexibility limit the usefulness of this approach. The third class comprises modern and flexible regression-based techniques that can be generalized to accommodate a wide range of outcome data including continuous, categorical, and count data. Such methods can be further divided into so-called ``population-average statistical models'' that focus on the specification of the mean response of the outcome estimated by generalized estimating equations, and ``subject-specific models'' that allow a full specification of the distribution of the outcome by using random effects to capture within-subject correlations. The choice as to which approach to choose partly depends on the aim of the research and the desired interpretation of the estimated effects (population-average versus subject-specific interpretation). This tutorial discusses aspects of the theoretical background for each technique, and with specific examples of studies published in               Anesthesia \& Analgesia               , demonstrates how these techniques are used in practice.},

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be regarded as gold standard in investigating dose-response and causal relationships in exercise science. Recommendations for exercise training routines and efficacy analyses of certain training regimen require valid data derived from robust RCTs. Moreover, meta-analyses rely on RCTs and both RCTs and meta-analyses are considered the highest level of scientific evidence. Beyond general study design a variety of methodological aspects and notable pitfalls has to be considered. Therefore, exercise training studies should be carefully constructed focusing on the consistency of the whole design "package" from an explicit hypothesis or research question over study design and methodology to data analysis and interpretation. The present scoping review covers all main aspects of planning, conducting, and analyzing exercise based RCTs. We aim to focus on relevant aspects regarding study design, statistical power, training planning and documentation as well as traditional and recent statistical approaches. We intend to provide a comprehensive hands-on paper for conceptualizing future exercise training studies and hope to stimulate and encourage researchers to conduct sound and valid RCTs in the field of exercise training.},

  abstract = {The maximum voluntary force (strength) which could be produced by the knee-extensor muscles, with the knee held at a right angle, was measured in a group of healthy young subjects comprising twenty-five males and twenty-five females. Both legs were tested: data from the stronger leg only for each subject were used in the present study. Computed tomography was used to obtain a cross-sectional image of the subjects' legs at mid-thigh level, measured as the mid-point between the greater trochanter and upper border of the patella. The cross-sectional area of the knee-extensor muscles was determined from the image obtained by computer-based planimetry. The subjects' height and weight were measured. An estimate of body fat content was obtained from measurements of skinfold thicknesses and used to calculate lean body mass. Male subjects were taller (P less than 0.001), heavier (P less than 0.001), leaner (P less than 0.001) and stronger (P less than 0.001) than the female subjects. No significant correlation was found to exist between strength of the knee-extensor muscles and body weight in the male or in the female subjects. In the male subjects, but not in the female group, there was a positive correlation (r = 0.50; P less than 0.01) between strength and lean body mass. Muscle cross-sectional area of the male subjects was greater than that of the female subjects (P less than 0.001). The ratio of strength to cross-sectional area for the male was 9.49 +/- 1.34 (mean +/- S.D.). This is greater but not significantly so, than that for females (8.92 +/- 1.11). In both male and female groups, there was a significant (P less than 0.01) positive correlation between muscle strength and cross-sectional area. A wide variation in the ratio of strength to muscle cross-sectional area was observed. This variability may be a result of anatomical differences between subjects or may result from differences in the proportions of different fibre types in the muscles. The variation between subjects is such that strength is not a useful predictive index of muscle cross-sectional area.},

However, it remains unknown whether changes in LBM are correlated with performance changes in powerlifters preparing for a competition. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in LBM and performance in powerlifters preparing for a competition. Eight male powerlifters (age 31.7 \textpm{} 9.8 years, height 1.77 \textpm{} 0.06 m, weight 99.2 \textpm{} 14.6 kg) and three female powerlifters (age 32.7 \textpm{} 16.3 years, height 1.54 \textpm{} 0.06 m, weight 66.6 \textpm{} 20.9 kg) participated in the study. The athletes followed individualized periodized training programs for 12 weeks, aiming to maximize their performance for the national championship. The maximum strength (1-RM) in the squat, bench press, and deadlift, body composition, handgrip strength, anaerobic power, quadriceps' cross-sectional area and vastus lateralis muscle architecture were measured before and after the training period. Significant increases were found after the training period in the squat (5.8 \textpm{} 7.0\%, p {$<$} 0.05), bench press (4.9 \textpm{} 9.8\%, p = 0.05) and deadlift (8.3 \textpm{} 16.7\%, p {$<$} 0.05). Significant correlations were found between the 1-RM and LBM before and after the training period (r {$>$} 0.75, p {$<$} 0.05). The changes in the 1-RM after the training intervention correlated with the changes in the total LBM (p {$<$} 0.05). These results suggest that individual changes in LBM due to systematic resistance training for a competition may dictate increases in the 1-RM strength in powerlifters.},

  abstract = {Trained individuals may require variations in training stimuli and advanced resistance training paradigms (ADV) to increase skeletal muscle hypertrophy. However, no meta-analysis has examined how ADV versus traditional (TRAD) approaches may differentially affect hypertrophic outcomes in trained populations. The aim of this review was to determine whether the skeletal muscle hypertrophy responses induced by TRAD differed from ADV in resistance-trained individuals. Furthermore, we sought to examine potential effects of dietary factors, participants' training status, and training loads. We searched for peer-reviewed, randomized controlled trials (published in English) conducted in healthy resistance-trained adults performing a period of TRAD and ADV with pre-to-post measurement(s) of muscle hypertrophy in PubMed, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and MEDLINE databases up to October 2022. A formal meta-analysis was conducted in Revman5, and risk of bias was assessed by ROB2. Ten studies met the inclusion criteria. Results indicated no difference between ADV and TRAD for muscle thickness (SMD\,=\,0.05, 95\% CI: -0.20 0.29,                                                   p                                               \,=\,0.70), lean mass (SMD\,=\,-0.01, 95\% CI: -0.26 0.23,                                                   p                                               \,=\,0.92), muscle cross-sectional area (SMD\,=\,-0.07, 95\% CI: -0.36 0.22,                                                   p                                               \,=\,0.64), or all measurements analyzed together (SMD\,=\,-0.00, 95\% CI: -0.15 0.14,                                                   p                                               \,=\,0.95). No heterogeneity or inconsistencies were observed; however, unclear risk of bias was present in most of the studies. Short-term ADV does not induce superior skeletal muscle hypertrophy responses when compared with TRAD in trained individuals. This review was not previously registered.},

Methods               Literature searches in the PubMed, SCOPUS and SPORTDiscus databases identified a total of 15 studies that measured muscle hypertrophy (in healthy adults of any age and resistance training experience) and compared  resistance training performed to: (A) momentary muscular failure versus non-failure; (B) set failure (defined as anything other than momentary muscular failure) versus non-failure; or (C) different velocity loss thresholds.                                         Results                                There was a trivial advantage for resistance training performed to set failure versus non-failure for muscle hypertrophy in studies applying any definition of set failure [effect size=0.19 (95\% confidence interval 0.00, 0.37),                 p                 =0.045], with no moderating effect of volume load (                 p                 =0.884) or relative load (                 p                 =0.525). Given the variability in set failure definitions applied across studies, sub-group analyses were conducted and found no advantage for either resistance training performed to momentary muscular failure versus non-failure for muscle hypertrophy [effect size=0.12 (95\% confidence interval -0.13, 0.37),                 p                 =0.343], or for resistance training performed to high ({$>$}25\%) versus moderate (20--25\%) velocity loss thresholds [effect size=0.08 (95\% confidence interval -0.16, 0.32),                 p                 =0.529].                                                        Conclusion               Overall, our main findings suggest that (i) there is no evidence to support that resistance training performed to momentary muscular failure is superior to non-failure resistance training for muscle hypertrophy and (ii) higher velocity loss thresholds, and theoretically closer proximities-to-failure do not always elicit greater muscle hypertrophy. As such, these results provide evidence for a potential non-linear relationship between proximity-to-failure and muscle hypertrophy.},

Searches of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Scopus were conducted for studies that met the following criteria: (a) an experimental trial involving both low-load training [{$\leq$}60\% 1 repetition maximum (1RM)] and high-load training ({$>$}60\% 1RM); (b) with all sets in the training protocols being performed to momentary muscular failure; (c) at least one method of estimating changes in muscle mass or dynamic, isometric, or isokinetic strength was used; (d) the training protocol lasted for a minimum of 6 weeks; (e) the study involved participants with no known medical conditions or injuries impairing training capacity. A total of 21 studies were ultimately included for analysis. Gains in 1RM strength were significantly greater in favor of high- vs. low-load training, whereas no significant differences were found for isometric strength between conditions. Changes in measures of muscle hypertrophy were similar between conditions. The findings indicate that maximal strength benefits are obtained from the use of heavy loads while muscle hypertrophy can be equally achieved across a spectrum of loading ranges.},

Nevertheless, claims continue to be made that analysis of covariance is biased if the groups are not equal at baseline. If the required equality were in expectation only, this would permit the use of ANCOVA in randomized clinical trials but not in observational studies. The discussion is related to Lord's paradox. In this note, it is shown, however that it is not a necessary condition for groups to be equal at baseline, not even in expectation, for ANCOVA to provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It is also shown that although many situations can be envisaged where ANCOVA is biased it is very difficult to imagine circumstances under which SACS would then be unbiased and a causal interpretation could be made.

We consider in detail issues pertaining to creating just two groups, a common approach in clinical research. We argue that the simplicity achieved is gained at a cost; dichotomization may create rather than avoid problems, notably a considerable loss of power and residual confounding. In addition, the use of a data-derived `optimal' cutpoint leads to serious bias. We illustrate the impact of dichotomization of continuous predictor variables using as a detailed case study a randomized trial in primary biliary cirrhosis. Dichotomization of continuous data is unnecessary for statistical analysis and in particular should not be applied to explanatory variables in regression models.

In many epidemiological studies, age is a scaled (continuous) variable prior to statistical analyses; however, despite pleas from methodologists, researchers frequently dichotomize age in their data analysis without an appropriate rationale. Using simulated case--control data, we show that dichotomizing age generally will lead to a biased odds ratio (OR). When age was a confounder (potentially representing common causes of risks and outcomes), including age as a scaled variable (whether the age effect was linear or non-linear in the logit), provided satisfactory control, whereas when age was categorized, the estimated risk factor effect was biased. We also demonstrate that the further the cutpoint is from the median age, the greater the increase in the OR; thus, in cases where age dichotomization is warranted, researchers are cautioned not to allow the size of the empirical OR to influence their choice of cutpoint. Recommendations are made for analysing age in epidemiological data and interpretation of empirical findings. Copyright \copyright{} 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In 17 studies, the reliability (               n               ~=~13) and validity (               n               ~=~8) of ultrasound to quantify muscles in community-dwelling older adults ({$\geq$}60~years) or a clinical population were evaluated. Four out of 13 reliability studies investigated both intra-rater and inter-rater reliability. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) scores for reliability ranged from -0.26 to 1.00. The highest ICC scores were found for the vastus lateralis, rectus femoris, upper arm anterior, and the trunk (ICC~=~0.72 to 1.000). All included validity studies found ICC scores ranging from 0.92 to 0.999. Two studies describing the validity of ultrasound to predict lean body mass showed good validity as compared with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (               r               2               ~=~0.92 to 0.96). This systematic review shows that ultrasound is a reliable and valid tool for the assessment of muscle size in older adults. More high-quality research is required to confirm these findings in both clinical and healthy populations. Furthermore, ultrasound assessment of small muscles needs further evaluation. Ultrasound to predict lean body mass is feasible; however, future research is required to validate prediction equations in older adults with varying function and health.},

A literature search on 3 databases (Pubmed, Scopus and Chocrane Library) was conducted in January 2021. After analyzing 2083 resultant articles, studies were included if they met the following inclusion criteria: a) studies were randomized controlled trials (with the number of sets explicitly reported), b) interventions lasted at least six weeks, c) participants had a minimum of one year of resistance training experience, d) participants' age ranged from 18 to 35 years, e) studies reported direct measurements of muscle thickness and/or the cross-sectional area, and f) studies were published in peer-review journals. Seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative analysis, whereas just six were included in the quantitative analysis. All participants were divided into three groups: "low" ({$<$}12 weekly sets), "moderate" (12-20 weekly sets) and "high" volume ({$>$}20 weekly sets). According to the results of this meta-analysis, there were no differences between moderate and high training volume responses for the quadriceps (p = 0.19) and the biceps brachii (p = 0.59). However, it appears that a high training volume is better to induce muscle mass gains in the triceps brachii (p = 0.01). According to the results of this review, a range of 12-20 weekly sets per muscle group may be an optimum standard recommendation for increasing muscle hypertrophy in young, trained men.},

We compared changes in active and inactive muscle CSA and PV after barbell squat exercise. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to quantify muscle involvement in exercise and to determine CSA of muscle groups or individual muscles [vasti (VS), adductor (Add), hamstring (Ham), and rectus femoris (RF)]. Muscle involvement in exercise was determined using exercise-induced contrast shift in spin-spin relaxation time (T2)-weighted MR images immediately postexercise. Alterations in muscle size were based on the mean CSA of individual slices. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, and Evans blue dye were used to estimate changes in PV. Muscle CSA and PV data were obtained preexercise and immediately postexercise and 15 and 45 min thereafter. A hierarchy of muscle involvement in exercise was found such that VS {$>$} Add {$>$} Ham {$>$} RF, with the Ham and RF showing essentially no involvement. CSA of the VS and Add muscle groups were increased 10 and 5\%, respectively, immediately after exercise in each thigh with no changes in Ham and RF CSA. PV was decreased 22\% immediately following exercise. The absolute loss of PV was correlated (r2 = 0.75) with absolute increase in muscle CSA immediately postexercise, supporting the notion that increased muscle size after resistance exercise reflects primarily fluid movement from the vascular space into active but not inactive muscle.},

  abstract = {Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) provides a measure of lean soft tissue (LST). LST hydration, often assumed to be constant, is relevant to several aspects of DEXA body composition estimates. The aims of this study were to develop a theoretical model of LST total body water (TBW) content and to examine hydration effects with empirically derived model coefficients and then to experimentally test the model's prediction that, in healthy adults, LST hydration is not constant but varies as a function of extra- and intracellular water distribution (E/I). The initial phase involved TBW/LST model development and application with empirically derived model coefficients. Model predictions were then tested in a cross-sectional study of 215 healthy adults. LST was measured by DEXA, extracellular water (ECW) by NaBr dilution, intracellular water (ICW) by whole body               40               K counting, and TBW by               2               H               2               O dilution. TBW estimates, calculated as ECW + ICW, were highly correlated with ( r = 0.97, SEE = 2.1 kg, P {$<$} 0.001) and showed no significant bias compared with TBW measured by               2               H               2               O. Model-predicted TBW/LST was almost identical to experimentally derived values (means \textpm{} SD) in the total group (0.767 vs. 0.764 \textpm{} 0.028). LST hydration was significantly correlated with E/I (total group, r = 0.30, SEE = 0.027, P {$<$} 0.001). Although E/I increased with age (men, r = 0.48; women, r = 0.37; both P {$<$} 0.001), the association between TBW/LST and age was nonsignificant. Hydration of the DEXA-derived LST compartment is thus not constant but varies predictably with ECW and ICW distribution. This observation has implications for the accuracy of body fat measurements by DEXA and the use of TBW as a means of checking DEXA system calibration.},

Few studies have investigated the ability of leg-to-leg BIA to detect change in percentage fat mass (\%FM) over time. Our objective was to determine the ability of leg-to-leg BIA vs. the four-compartment (4C) model to detect small changes in \%FM in overweight adults.                                         Research Methods and Procedures:               Thirty-eight overweight adults (BMI, 25.0 to 29.9 kg/m               2               ; age, 18 to 44 years; 31 women) participated in a 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of a nutritional supplement. Body composition was measured at 0 and 6 months using the Tanita TBF-305 body fat analyzer [using equations derived by the manufacturer (\%FM               T-Man               ) and by Jebb et al.

Results:               Subjects in the experimental group lost 0.9\%FM               4C               (               p               = 0.03), a loss that did not reach significance using leg-to-leg BIA (0.6\%FM               T-Man               ,               p               = 0.151; 0.6\%FM               T-Jebb               ,               p               = 0.144). We observed large standard deviations (SDs) in the mean difference in \%FM between the 4C model and the Tanita               Manufacturer               (2.5\%) and Tanita               Jebb               (2.2\%).

  abstract = {Whilst the assessment of body composition is routine practice in sport, there remains considerable debate on the best tools available, with the chosen technique often based upon convenience rather than understanding the method and its limitations. The aim of this manuscript was threefold: (1) provide an overview of the common methodologies used within sport to measure body composition, specifically hydro-densitometry, air displacement plethysmography, bioelectrical impedance analysis and spectroscopy, ultra-sound, three-dimensional scanning, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and skinfold thickness; (2) compare the efficacy of what are widely believed to be the most accurate (DXA) and practical (skinfold thickness) assessment tools and (3) provide a framework to help select the most appropriate assessment in applied sports practice including insights from the authors' experiences working in elite sport. Traditionally, skinfold thickness has been the most popular method of body composition but the use of DXA has increased in recent years, with a wide held belief that it is the criterion standard. When bone mineral content needs to be assessed, and/or when it is necessary to take limb-specific estimations of fat and fat-free mass, then DXA appears to be the preferred method, although it is crucial to be aware of the logistical constraints required to produce reliable data, including controlling food intake, prior exercise and hydration status. However, given the need for simplicity and after considering the evidence across all assessment methods, skinfolds appear to be the least affected by day-to-day variability, leading to the conclusion `come back skinfolds, all is forgiven'.},

The primary objective of the present study was to validate body fat estimates from individual methods using the 4-compartment (4C) model as reference. The second objective was to obtain estimates of hydration of fat free mass (FFM) using the 4C model. METHODS: The body fat of 39 adults (19 men and 20 women) aged 20-40 yr was estimated using air displacement plethysmography (ADP), dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), 4-skinfold technique and bio-electrical impedance (BIA). Total body water was estimated using isotope dilution method. RESULTS: All the methods underestimated body fat when compared to 4C model, except for DEXA and the mean difference from the reference was lowest for DEXA and ADP. The precision of the fat mass estimated from 4C model using the propagation of error was 0.25 kg, while the mean hydration factor obtained by the 4C model was found to be 0.74 \textpm{} 0.02 in the whole group of men and women. INTERPRETATIONS \& CONCLUSION: The results of the present study suggest that DEXA and ADP methods can provide reasonably accurate estimates of body fat, while skinfold and bio-electrical impedance methods require the use of population specific equations.},

  abstract = {Body composition is known to be associated with several diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers, osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Body composition measurements are useful in assessing the effectiveness of nutritional interventions and monitoring the changes associated with growth and disease conditions. Changes in body composition occur when there is a mismatch between nutrient intake and requirement. Altered body composition is observed in conditions such as wasting and stunting when the nutritional intake may be inadequate. Overnutrition on the other hand leads to obesity. Many techniques are available for body composition assessment, which range from simple indirect measures to more sophisticated direct volumetric measurements. Some of the methods that are used today include anthropometry, tracer dilution, densitometry, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, air displacement plethysmography and bioelectrical impedance analysis. The methods vary in their precision and accuracy. Imaging techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography have become powerful tools due to their ability of visualizing and quantifying tissues, organs, or constituents such as muscle and adipose tissue. However, these methods are still considered to be research tools due to their cost and complexity of use. This review was aimed to describe the commonly used methods for body composition analysis and provide a brief introduction on the latest techniques available.},

Validity of selected bioimpedance equations for estimating body composition in men and women: a four-compartment model comparison.               J Strength Cond Res               31(7): 1963--1972, 2017---The purpose of this study was to compare body fat percentage (BF\%) and fat-free mass (FFM) values from bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) equations to values determined from a 4-compartment (4C) model. Eighty-two adults (42 men and 40 women) volunteered to participate (age = 23 \textpm{} 5 years). Body fat percentage and FFM were estimated from previously developed BIA equations by Chumlea et al. (BIA               CH               ), Deurenberg et al. (BIA               DE               ), Kyle et al. (BIA               KYLE               ), and Sun et al. (BIA               SUN               ). Four-compartment model body composition was derived from underwater weighing for body density, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for bone mineral content, and bioimpedance spectroscopy for total body water. The standard error of estimate (SEE) for group BF\% and FFM ranged from 3.0 to 3.8\% and 2.1 to 2.7 kg, respectively. The constant error (CE) was significantly higher and lower for BF\% and FFM (               p               {$<$} 0.001), respectively, for 3 BIA equations (BIA               CH               , CE = 3.1\% and -2.2 kg; BIA               DE               , CE = 3.7\% and -2.9 kg; BIA               KYLE               , CE = 2.3\% and -1.9 kg), but was not significant for BF\% (               p               = 0.702) and FFM (               p               = 0.677) for BIA               SUN               (CE = -0.1\% and 0.1 kg). The 95\% limits of agreement were narrowest for BIA               CH               (\textpm 5.9\%; \textpm 4.2 kg) and largest for BIA               DE               (\textpm 7.4\%; \textpm 6.2 kg). The significant CE yielded by BIA               CH               , BIA               DE               , and BIA               KYLE               indicates these equations tend to overpredict group BF\% and underestimate group FFM. However, all BIA equations produced low SEEs and fairly narrow limits of agreement. When the use of a 4C model is not available, practitioners might consider using one of the selected BIA equations, but should consider the associated CE.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) provides an affordable and practical assessment of multiple whole body and regional body composition. However, little information is available on the assessment of changes in body composition in top-level athletes using DXA. The present study aimed to assess the accuracy of DXA in tracking body composition changes (relative fat mass [\%FM], absolute fat mass [FM], and fat-free mass [FFM]) of elite male judo athletes from a period of weight stability to prior to a competition, compared to a four compartment model (4C model), as the criterion method.                                         Methods                                A total of 27 elite male judo athletes (age, 22.2 \textpm{} 2.8 yrs) athletes were evaluated. Measures of body volume by air displacement plethysmography, bone mineral content assessed by DXA, and total-body water assessed by deuterium dilution were used in a 4C model. Statistical analyses included examination of the coefficient of determinant (r                 2                 ), standard error of estimation (SEE), slope, intercept, and agreement between models.                                                        Results               At a group level analysis, changes in \%FM, FM, and FFM estimates by DXA were not significantly different from those by the 4C model. Though the regression between DXA and the 4C model did not differ from the line of identity DXA \%FM, FM, and FFM changes only explained 29\%, 36\%, and 38\% of the 4C reference values, respectively. Individual results showed that the 95\% limits of agreement were -3.7 to 5.3 for \%FM, -2.6 to 3.7 for FM, and -3.7 to 2.7 for FFM. The relation between the difference and the mean of the methods indicated a significant trend for \%FM and FM changes with DXA overestimating at the lower ends and underestimating at the upper ends of FM changes.                                         Conclusions               Our data indicate that both at group and individual levels DXA did not present an expected accuracy in tracking changes in adiposity in elite male judo athletes.},

Seventy-three healthy participants aged 19--50 years were assessed by each of fifteen BIA devices, with resulting body fat percentage estimates compared with a 4C model utilising air displacement plethysmography, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and bioimpedance spectroscopy. A subset of thirty-seven participants returned for a second visit 12--16 weeks later and were included in an analysis of longitudinal validity. The sample of devices included fourteen consumer-grade and one research-grade model in a variety of configurations: hand-to-hand, foot-to-foot and bilateral hand-to-foot (octapolar). BIA devices demonstrated high reliability, with precision error ranging from 0{$\cdot$}0 to 0{$\cdot$}49 \%. Cross-sectional validity varied, with constant error relative to the 4C model ranging from -3{$\cdot$}5 (               sd               4{$\cdot$}1) \% to 11{$\cdot$}7 (               sd               4{$\cdot$}7) \%, standard error of the estimate values of 3{$\cdot$}1--7{$\cdot$}5 \% and Lin's concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of 0{$\cdot$}48--0{$\cdot$}94. For longitudinal validity, constant error ranged from -0{$\cdot$}4 (               sd               2{$\cdot$}1) \% to 1{$\cdot$}3 (               sd               2{$\cdot$}7) \%, with standard error of the estimate values of 1{$\cdot$}7--2{$\cdot$}6 \% and Lin's CCC of 0{$\cdot$}37--0{$\cdot$}78. While performance varied widely across the sample investigated, select models of BIA devices (particularly octapolar and select foot-to-foot devices) may hold potential utility for the tracking of body composition over time, particularly in contexts in which the purchase or use of a research-grade device is infeasible.},

Linear regression and a Bland and Altman plot demonstrated the tendency for DEXA to progressively underestimate the \%BF of leaner individuals compared with the criterion 4C model (4C \%BF = 0.862 \texttimes{} DEXA \%BF + 4.417; r               2               = 0.952, standard error of estimate = 1.6\% BF).
