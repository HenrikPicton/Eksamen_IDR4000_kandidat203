  abstract = {Abstract             The aim of this study was to compare the effects of progressive overload in                     resistance training on muscle strength and cross-sectional area (CSA) by                     specifically comparing the impact of increasing load (LOADprog) versus an                     increase in repetitions (REPSprog). We used a within-subject experimental design                     in which 39 previously untrained young persons (20 men and 19 women) had their                     legs randomized to LOADprog and REPSprog. Outcomes were assessed before and                     after 10 weeks of training. Muscle strength was assessed using the one                     repetition maximum (1RM) test on the leg extension exercise, and the CSA of the                     vastus lateralis was assessed by ultrasonography. Both protocols increased 1RM                     values from pre (LOADprog: 52.90\textpm 16.32\,kg; REPSprog: 51.67\textpm 15.84\,kg) to post                     (LOADprog: 69.05\textpm 18.55\,kg, REPSprog: 66.82\textpm 17.95\,kg), with no difference between                     them (P+{$>$}+0.05). Similarly, both protocols also increased in CSA                     values from pre (LOADprog: 21.34\textpm 4.71\,cm{$^2$}; REPSprog: 21.08\textpm 4.62\,cm{$^2$}) to post                     (LOADprog: 23.53\textpm 5.41\,cm{$^2$}, REPSprog: 23.39\textpm 5.19\,cm{$^2$}), with no difference between                     them (P+{$>$}+0.05). In conclusion, our findings indicate that the                     progression of overload through load or repetitions can be used to promote gains                     in strength and muscle hypertrophy in young men and women in the early stages of                     training.},

Greater gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy after partial range of motion training performed at long muscle lengths.               J Strength Cond Res               37(9): 1746--1753, 2023---Whether there is an optimal range of motion (ROM) to induce muscle hypertrophy remains elusive, especially for gastrocnemius. This study aimed to compare the changes in gastrocnemius muscle thickness between calf raise exercise performed with full ROM (FULL               ROM               ), partial ROM performed in the initial (INITIAL               ROM               ), and final (FINAL               ROM               ) portions of the ROM. Forty-two young women performed a calf training program for 8 weeks, 3 days{$\cdot$}week               -1               , with differences in the calf raise ROM configuration. The calf raise exercise was performed in a pin-loaded, horizontal, leg-press machine, in 3 sets of 15--20 repetition maximum. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: FULL               ROM               (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), INITIAL               ROM               (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to 0{$^\circ$}), and FINAL               ROM               (ankle: 0{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), where 0{$^\circ$} was defined as an angle of 90{$^\circ$} of the foot with the tibia. The muscle thickness measurements of medial and lateral gastrocnemius were taken by means of B-mode ultrasound. INITIAL               ROM               elicited greater medial gastrocnemius increases than FULL               ROM               and FINAL               ROM               (INITIAL               ROM               = +15.2\% vs. FULL               ROM               = +6.7\% and FINAL               ROM               = +3.4\%;               p               {$\leq$} 0.009). Furthermore, INITIAL               ROM               elicited greater lateral gastrocnemius increases than FINAL               ROM               (INITIAL               ROM               = +14.9\% vs. FINAL               ROM               = +6.2\%;               p               {$<$} 0.024) but did not significantly differ from FULL               ROM               (FULL               ROM               = +7.3\%;               p               = 0.060). The current results suggest that calf training performed at longer muscle lengths may optimize gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy in young women. Therefore, when prescribing hypertrophy-oriented training, the inclusion of the calf raise exercise performed with partial ROM in the initial portion of the excursion should be considered.},

This study aimed to compare the changes in lower limbs maximal dynamic strength (1RM) and quadriceps femoris cross-sectional area (CSA) after a RT with different weekly frequencies in strength-trained individuals using a within-subject design. Twenty-four men participated in a 9-week RT program, being randomly divided into two conditions: resistance training with equalized total training volume (RTEV) and with unequalized total training volume (RTUV). The RT protocol used the unilateral leg press 45{$^\circ$} exercise and each subject's lower limb executed one of the proposed frequencies (one and three times/week). All conditions effectively increased 1RM and CSA (p{$<$}0.001); however, no significant differences were observed in the values of 1RM (p = 0.454) and CSA (p = 0.310) between the RT frequencies in the RTEV and RTUV conditions. Therefore, RT performed three times a week showed similar increases in 1RM and CSA to the program performed once a week, regardless of training volume equalization. Nevertheless, when the higher RT frequency allowed the application of a greater TTV (i.e., RTUV), higher effect size (ES) values (0.51 and 0.63, 1RM and CSA, respectively) were observed for the adaptations.},

  abstract = {Limited research exists examining how resistance training to failure affects applied outcomes and single motor unit characteristics in previously trained individuals. Herein, resistance-trained adults (24\,\textpm\,3\,years old, self-reported resistance training experience was 6\,\textpm\,4\,years, 11 men and 8 women) were randomly assigned to either a low-repetitions-in-reserve (RIR; i.e., training near failure, n\,=\,10) or high-RIR (i.e., not training near failure, n\,=\,9) group. All participants implemented progressive overload during 5\,weeks where low-RIR performed squat, bench press, and deadlift twice weekly and were instructed to end each training set with 0-1 RIR. high-RIR performed identical training except for being instructed to maintain 4-6 RIR after each set. During week 6, participants performed a reduced volume-load. The following were assessed prior to and following the intervention: (i) vastus lateralis (VL) muscle cross-sectional area (mCSA) at multiple sites; (ii) squat, bench press, and deadlift one-repetition maximums (1RMs); and (iii) maximal isometric knee extensor torque and VL motor unit firing rates during an 80\% maximal voluntary contraction. Although RIR was lower in the low- versus high-RIR group during the intervention (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), total training volume did not significantly differ between groups (p\,=\,0.222). There were main effects of time for squat, bench press, and deadlift 1RMs (all p-values\,{$<$}\,0.05), but no significant condition\,\texttimes\,time interactions existed for these or proximal/middle/distal VL mCSA data. There were significant interactions for the slope and y-intercept of the motor unit mean firing rate versus recruitment threshold relationship. Post hoc analyses indicated low-RIR group slope values decreased and y-intercept values increased after training suggesting low-RIR training increased lower-threshold motor unit firing rates. This study provides insight into how resistance training in proximity to failure affects strength, hypertrophy, and single motor unit characteristics, and may inform those who aim to program for resistance-trained individuals.},

J Strength Cond Res               30(7): 1805--1812, 2016---The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of short rest intervals normally associated with hypertrophy-type training versus long rest intervals traditionally used in strength-type training on muscular adaptations in a cohort of young, experienced lifters. Twenty-one young resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to either a group that performed a resistance training (RT) program with 1-minute rest intervals (SHORT) or a group that employed 3-minute rest intervals (LONG). All other RT variables were held constant. The study period lasted 8 weeks with subjects performing 3 total body workouts a week comprised 3 sets of 8--12 repetition maximum (RM) of 7 different exercises per session. Testing was performed prestudy and poststudy for muscle strength (1RM bench press and back squat), muscle endurance (50\% 1RM bench press to failure), and muscle thickness of the elbow flexors, triceps brachii, and quadriceps femoris by ultrasound imaging. Maximal strength was significantly greater for both 1RM squat and bench press for LONG compared to SHORT. Muscle thickness was significantly greater for LONG compared to SHORT in the anterior thigh, and a trend for greater increases was noted in the triceps brachii (               p               = 0.06) as well. Both groups saw significant increases in local upper body muscle endurance with no significant differences noted between groups. This study provides evidence that longer rest periods promote greater increases in muscle strength and hypertrophy in young resistance-trained men.},

Methods                                Thirty-four healthy resistance-trained men were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: a low-volume group performing one set per exercise per training session (                 n                 = 11), a moderate-volume group performing three sets per exercise per training session (                 n                 = 12), or a high-volume group performing five sets per exercise per training session (                 n                 = 11). Training for all routines consisted of three weekly sessions performed on nonconsecutive days for 8 wk. Muscular strength was evaluated with one repetition maximum (RM) testing for the squat and bench press. Upper-body muscle endurance was evaluated using 50\% of subjects bench press 1RM performed to momentary failure. Muscle hypertrophy was evaluated using B-mode ultrasonography for the elbow flexors, elbow extensors, mid-thigh, and lateral thigh.                                                        Results               Results showed significant preintervention to postintervention increases in strength and endurance in all groups, with no significant between-group differences. Alternatively, while all groups increased muscle size in most of the measured sites from preintervention to postintervention, significant increases favoring the higher-volume conditions were seen for the elbow flexors, mid-thigh, and lateral thigh.                                         Conclusions               Marked increases in strength and endurance can be attained by resistance-trained individuals with just three 13-min weekly sessions over an 8-wk period, and these gains are similar to that achieved with a substantially greater time commitment. Alternatively, muscle hypertrophy follows a dose--response relationship, with increasingly greater gains achieved with higher training volumes.},

Post-hoc testing showed no difference between both intervention groups regarding maximal strength and muscle thickness (                 p                 \,=\,0.905--0.983,                 d                 \,=\,0.036--0.087), while flexibility increased in the stretching group (                 p                 \,=\,0.001,                 d                 \,=\,0.789).                                                        Conclusion               Stretching showed increases in maximal strength and hypertrophy, which were comparable with commonly used resistance training. Based on current literature, the influence of mechanical tension as the underlying mechanism is discussed. Furthermore, as equipment and comparatively long stretching durations are requested to induce meaningful strength increases in recreationally active participants, practical application seems limited to special circumstances.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Myofibrils in muscle fibres of different sizes and different ages were examined and measured using phase-contrast and electron microscopy. During the post-natal growth of the mouse biceps brachii muscle the number of myofibnls in some fibres increases from about 75 to 1200 The range of myofibnl size was from 0{$\cdot$}4--12 {$\mu$}m. The distribution of myofibnl sizes in muscles of all ages studied was bimodal             A high incidence of longitudinal splitting of myofibrils was observed with the electron micro scope in differentiating muscle fibres and in some medium and large muscle fibres. Size measurements with the electron microscope showed that the splitting myofibrils were about twice as large as non-splitting myofibrils and that the myofibrils split more or less down the middle. A possible explanation for the splitting is that the peripheral I filaments are pulled at an angle slightly oblique to the myofibnl axis, because of the discrepancy in the A and I-filament lattice spacings. When the myofibnl reaches a certain size the oblique pull of the peripheral I filaments is strong enough to cause the Z disks to rip.             From data on the size, shape and number of myofibnls at different stages of growth it was concluded that longitudinal splitting is the means by which the number of myofibrils increases during post-natal growth.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomography (CT) are promising reference methods for quantifying whole body and regional skeletal muscle mass. Earlier MRI and CT validation studies used data-acquisition techniques and data-analysis procedures now outdated, evaluated anatomic rather than adipose tissue-free skeletal muscle (ATFSM), studied only the relatively large thigh, or found unduly large estimation errors. The aim of the present study was to compare arm and leg ATFSM cross-sectional area estimates (cm               2               ) by using standard MRI and CT acquisition and image-analysis methods with corresponding cadaver estimates. A second objective was to validate MRI and CT measurements of adipose tissue embedded within muscle (interstitial adipose tissue) and surrounding muscle (subcutaneous adipose tissue). ATFSM area ( n = 119) by MRI [38.9 \textpm{} 22.3 (SD) cm               2               ], CT (39.7 \textpm{} 22.8 cm               2               ), and cadaver (39.5 \textpm{} 23.0 cm               2               ) were not different ( P {$>$} 0.001), and both MRI and CT estimates of ATFSM were highly correlated with corresponding cadaver values [MRI: r = 0.99, SE of estimate (SEE) 3.9 cm               2               , P {$<$} 0.001; and CT: r = 0.99, SEE = 3.8 cm               2               , P {$<$} 0.001]. Similarly good results were observed between MRI- and CT-measured vs. cadaver-measured interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue. For MRI-ATFSM the intraobserver correlation for duplicate measurements in vivo was 0.99 [SEE = 8.7 cm               2               (2.9\%), P {$<$} 0.001]. These findings strongly support the use of MRI and CT as reference methods for appendicular skeletal muscle, interstitial and subcutaneous adipose tissue measurement in vivo.},

  abstract = {Reliability, the consistency of a test or measurement, is frequently quantified in the movement sciences literature. A common metric is the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). In addition, the SEM, which can be calculated from the ICC, is also frequently reported in reliability studies. However, there are several versions of the ICC, and confusion exists in the movement sciences regarding which ICC to use. Further, the utility of the SEM is not fully appreciated. In this review, the basics of classic reliability theory are addressed in the context of choosing and interpreting an ICC. The primary distinction between ICC equations is argued to be one concerning the inclusion (equations 2,1 and 2,k) or exclusion (equations 3,1 and 3,k) of systematic error in the denominator of the ICC equation. Inferential tests of mean differences, which are performed in the process of deriving the necessary variance components for the calculation of ICC values, are useful to determine if systematic error is present. If so, the measurement schedule should be modified (removing trials where learning and/or fatigue effects are present) to remove systematic error, and ICC equations that only consider random error may be safely used. The use of ICC values is discussed in the context of estimating the effects of measurement error on sample size, statistical power, and correlation attenuation. Finally, calculation and application of the SEM are discussed. It is shown how the SEM and its variants can be used to construct confidence intervals for individual scores and to determine the minimal difference needed to be exhibited for one to be confident that a true change in performance of an individual has occurred.},

  abstract = {Anesthesia, critical care, perioperative, and pain research often involves study designs in which the same outcome variable is repeatedly measured or observed over time on the same patients. Such repeatedly measured data are referred to as longitudinal data, and longitudinal study designs are commonly used to investigate changes in an outcome over time and to compare these changes among treatment groups. From a statistical perspective, longitudinal studies usually increase the precision of estimated treatment effects, thus increasing the power to detect such effects. Commonly used statistical techniques mostly assume independence of the observations or measurements. However, values repeatedly measured in the same individual will usually be more similar to each other than values of different individuals and ignoring the correlation between repeated measurements may lead to biased estimates as well as invalid               P               values and confidence intervals. Therefore, appropriate analysis of repeated-measures data requires specific statistical techniques. This tutorial reviews 3 classes of commonly used approaches for the analysis of longitudinal data. The first class uses summary statistics to condense the repeatedly measured information to a single number per subject, thus basically eliminating within-subject repeated measurements and allowing for a straightforward comparison of groups using standard statistical hypothesis tests. The second class is historically popular and comprises the repeated-measures analysis of variance type of analyses. However, strong assumptions that are seldom met in practice and low flexibility limit the usefulness of this approach. The third class comprises modern and flexible regression-based techniques that can be generalized to accommodate a wide range of outcome data including continuous, categorical, and count data. Such methods can be further divided into so-called ``population-average statistical models'' that focus on the specification of the mean response of the outcome estimated by generalized estimating equations, and ``subject-specific models'' that allow a full specification of the distribution of the outcome by using random effects to capture within-subject correlations. The choice as to which approach to choose partly depends on the aim of the research and the desired interpretation of the estimated effects (population-average versus subject-specific interpretation). This tutorial discusses aspects of the theoretical background for each technique, and with specific examples of studies published in               Anesthesia \& Analgesia               , demonstrates how these techniques are used in practice.},

  abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) can be regarded as gold standard in investigating dose-response and causal relationships in exercise science. Recommendations for exercise training routines and efficacy analyses of certain training regimen require valid data derived from robust RCTs. Moreover, meta-analyses rely on RCTs and both RCTs and meta-analyses are considered the highest level of scientific evidence. Beyond general study design a variety of methodological aspects and notable pitfalls has to be considered. Therefore, exercise training studies should be carefully constructed focusing on the consistency of the whole design "package" from an explicit hypothesis or research question over study design and methodology to data analysis and interpretation. The present scoping review covers all main aspects of planning, conducting, and analyzing exercise based RCTs. We aim to focus on relevant aspects regarding study design, statistical power, training planning and documentation as well as traditional and recent statistical approaches. We intend to provide a comprehensive hands-on paper for conceptualizing future exercise training studies and hope to stimulate and encourage researchers to conduct sound and valid RCTs in the field of exercise training.},
