# Assignment 1 - Effect of resistance training on muscle hypertrophy

## 1.1 Choice of subject
Muscle hypertrophy is the growth of individual muscle fibers that results from an increase in the number of sarcomeres in parallel within the myofibrils [@goldspinkProliferationMyofibrilsMuscle1970]. Traditional resistance training is known to increase hypertrophy, which in turn increase muscle size and strength [@schoenfeldMechanismsMuscleHypertrophy2010]. 

## 1.2 Finding the literature
All literature discussed in this assignment were accessed through PubMed [@NationalCenterBiotechnology]. Only one set of key words was used to find the studies: (((Strength training) AND (muscle hypertrophy)) OR (muscle mass)) OR (lean mass), «clinical trial» or «Randomized controlled trial» published between 2005 and 2025. Of 4121 results 10 studies including a measurement of muscle mass pre and post an intervention were chosen (Table 1).
